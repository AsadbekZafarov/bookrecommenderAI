{"model":"core.Books_seller","fields":{"Title":"The Da Vinci Code","Author":"Dan Brown","Description":"Harvard professor Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call while on business in Paris: the elderly curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauni're, has been brutally murdered inside the museum. Alongside the body, police have found a series of baffling codes. As Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, begin to sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to find a trail that leads to the works of Leonardo Da Vinci - and suggests the answer to a mystery that stretches deep into the vault of history. Langdon suspects the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion - a centuries old secret society - and has sacrificed his life to protect the Priory's most sacred trust: the location of a vastly important religious relic hidden for centuries. But it now appears that Opus Dei, a clandestine sect that has long plotted to seize the Prirory's secret, has now made its move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine code and quickly assemble the pieces of the puzzle, the Priory's secret - and a stunning historical truth - will be lost forever. Breaking the mould of traditional suspense novels, The DA VINCI CODE is simultaneously lightning-paced, intelligent and intricately layered with remarkable research and detail. And in this exclusive edition Dan Brown allows the reader behind the scenes of the novel which now incorporates over 150 photographs and illustrations throughout the text showing the rich historical tapestry from which he drew his inspiration. The visual sources which provide both the backdrop and the stimulus for the novel's action are revealed for the first time and uniquely complement the reading experience.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=A-AS46wG0p8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}}

With craft, wonder, and wit, the film captures the most engaging elements of the novel while artfully translating its literary point of view into cinematic terms that expand on the world established in the book series and previous films. In this book, Patrick Keating examines how Cuar\u00f3n and his collaborators employ cinematography, production design, music, performance, costume, dialogue, and more to create the richly textured world of Harry Potter\u2014a world filtered principally through Harry\u2019s perspective, characterized by gaps, uncertainties, and surprises. Rather than upholding the vision of a single auteur, Keating celebrates Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s direction as a collaborative achievement that resulted in a family blockbuster layered with thematic insights.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=1YcHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}
{"model":"core.Books_seller","fields":{"Title":"Angels and Demons in Art","Author":"Rosa Giorgi","Description":"This sumptuously illustrated volume analyzes artists' representations of angels and demons and heaven and hell from the Judeo-Christian tradition and describes how these artistic portrayals evolved over time. As with other books in the Guide to Imagery series, the goal of this volume is to help contemporary art enthusiasts decode the symbolic meanings in the great masterworks of Western Art. The first chapter traces the development of images of the Creation and the Afterworld from descriptions of them in the Scriptures through their evolution in later literary and philosophical works. The following two chapters examine artists' depictions of the two paths that humans may take, the path of evil or the path of salvation, and the punishments or rewards found on each. A chapter on the Judgment Day and the end of the world explores portrayals of the mysterious worlds between life and death and in the afterlife. Finally, the author looks at images of angelic and demonic beings themselves and how they came to be portrayed with the physical attributes--wings, halos, horns, and cloven hooves--with which we are now so familiar. Thoroughly researched by and expert in the field of iconography, Angels and Demons in Art will delight readers with an interest in art or religious symbolism.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=PEyRIARaKhAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail\u2014well, most of it. In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand\u2014and, if possible, answer\u2014the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world\u2019s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=hhnIWGD5Zt0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

Should she stay mortal and strengthen her connection to the werewolves, or leave it all behind to become a vampire? When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options. How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved? To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs. This astonishing, breathlessly anticipated conclusion to the Twilight Saga illuminates the secrets and mysteries of this spellbinding romantic epic. It's here! #1 bestselling author Stephenie Meyer makes a triumphant return to the world of Twilight with the highly anticipated companion, Midnight Sun: the iconic love story of Bella and Edward told from the vampire's point of view. \"People do not want to just read Meyer's books; they want to climb inside them and live there.\" -- Time \"A literary phenomenon.\" -- The New York Times","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=fZQ0AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

In The World According to Clarkson, he reveals why it is that: \u2022 Too much science is bad for our health \u2022 '70s rock music is nothing to be ashamed of \u2022 Hunting foxes while drunk and wearing night-sights is neither big nor clever \u2022 We must work harder to get rid of cricket \u2022 He liked the Germans (well, sometimes) With a strong dose of common sense that is rarely, if ever, found inside the M25, Clarkson hilariously attacks the pompous, the ridiculous, the absurd and the downright idiotic, whilst also celebrating the eccentric, the clever and the sheer bloody brilliant. Less a manifesto for living and more a road map to modern life, The World According to Clarkson is the funniest book you'll read this year. Don't leave home without it. The World According to Clarkson is a hilarious collection of Jeremy's Sunday Times columns and the first in his The World According to Clarkson series which also includes And Another Thing . . . , For Crying Out Loud! and How Hard Can It Be? Praise for Jeremy Clarkson: 'Brilliant . . . laugh-out-loud' Daily Telegraph 'Outrageously funny . . . will have you in stitches' Time Out Number-one bestseller and presenter of the hugely popular Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson writes on cars, current affairs and anything else that annoys him in his sharp and funny collections. Born To Be Riled, Clarkson On Cars, Don't Stop Me Now, Driven To Distraction, Round the Bend, Motorworld, and I Know You Got Soul are also available as Penguin paperbacks; the Penguin App iClarkson: The Book of Carscan be downloaded on the App Store.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=KBpq_gf4Va8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

{"model":"core.Books_seller","fields":{"Title":"The Sound of Laughter","Author":"Peter Kay","Description":"Peter Kay's unerring gift for observing the absurdities and eccentricities of family life has earned himself a widespread, everyman appeal. These vivid observations coupled with a kind of nostalgia that never fails to grab his audience's shared understanding, have earned him comparisons with Alan Bennett and Ronnie Barker. In his award winning TV series' he creates worlds populated by degenerate, bitter, useless, endearing and always recognisable characters which have attracted a huge and loyal following. In many ways he's an old fashioned kind of comedian and the scope and enormity of his fanbase reflects this. He doesn't tell jokes about politics or sex, but rather rejoices in the far funnier areas of life: elderly relatives and answering machines, dads dancing badly at weddings, garlic bread and cheesecake, your mum's HRT... His autobiography is full of this kind of humour and nostalgia, beginning with Kay's first ever driving lesson, taking him back through his Bolton childhood, the numerous jobs he held after school and leading up until the time he passed his driving test and found fame.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=L-4KWVoX7skC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

Nominated as one of America\u2019s best-loved novels by PBS\u2019s The Great American Read Speaking to us with the wisdom of age and in a voice at once haunting and startlingly immediate, Nitta Sayuri tells the story of her life as a geisha. It begins in a poor fishing village in 1929, when, as a nine-year-old girl with unusual blue-gray eyes, she is taken from her home and sold into slavery to a renowned geisha house. We witness her transformation as she learns the rigorous arts of the geisha: dance and music; wearing kimono, elaborate makeup, and hair; pouring sake to reveal just a touch of inner wrist; competing with a jealous rival for men's solicitude and the money that goes with it. In Memoirs of a Geisha, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction\u2014at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful\u2014and completely unforgettable.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=SOM54qQ6BgkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

A devoted wife and mother, businesswoman, TV star and award-winning producer, Sharon Osbourne has, in her own words, \"lived fifty lives in fifty years\". Her childhood with her father, the notorious rock manager Don Arden, was an unruly mix of glamour and violence. In her late 20s, Sharon finally made the painful decision to break with her family. Always irrepressible, Sharon flourished, creating a loving family of her own while becoming a legendary manager and rock band promoter. In rock star Ozzy Osbourne, Sharon found her soul mate, yet Ozzy's drug and drink-fueled excesses-which culminated in his attempt to strangle her-made their marriage a white-knuckle ride from the start. Only her devotion to their three children gave her the will to survive. From the tremendous highs of the hit show The Osbournes to the devastating lows of Ozzy's near-fatal quad-bike accident and her own bout with colon cancer, Sharon's tenacity, honesty, and humor have triumphed again and again.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=1c83AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

His aim was to take stock of the nation's public face and private parts (as it were), and to analyse what precisely it was he loved so much about a country that had produced Marmite; a military hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy; place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowells; people who said 'Mustn't grumble', and \u2018Ooh lovely\u2019 at the sight of a cup of tea and a plate of biscuits; and Gardeners' Question Time.

Richard Dawkins so stands out through the cutting intelligence of e God Delusion\u2019 James D. Watson, Nobel Laureate and co-discoverer of DNA ---------- The God Delusion caused a sensation when it was published in 2006. Within weeks it became the most hotly debated topic, with Dawkins himself branded as either saint or sinner for presenting his hard-hitting, impassioned rebuttal of religion of all types. His argument could hardly be more topical. While Europe is becoming increasingly secularized, the rise of religious fundamentalism, whether in the Middle East or Middle America, is dramatically and dangerously dividing opinion around the world. In America, and elsewhere, a vigorous dispute between 'intelligent design' and Darwinism is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science. In many countries religious dogma from medieval times still serves to abuse basic human rights such as women's and gay rights. And all from a belief in a God whose existence lacks evidence of any kind. Dawkins attacks God in all his forms. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry and abuses children. The God Delusion is a brilliantly argued, fascinating polemic: required reading for anyone interested in this most emotional and important subject.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=grccDzrTWLUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

But the truth is that Zadie Smith\u2019s voice is remarkably, fluently, and altogether wonderfully her own. At the center of this invigorating novel are two unlikely friends, Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal. Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England\u2019s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn\u2019t quite match her name (Jamaican for \u201cno problem\u201d). Samad\u2019s late-in-life arranged marriage (he had to wait for his bride to be born), produces twin sons whose separate paths confound Iqbal\u2019s every effort to direct them, and a renewed, if selective, submission to his Islamic faith. \u201c[White Teeth] is, like the London it portrays, a restless hybrid of voices, tones, and textures\u2026with a raucous energy and confidence.\u201d \u2014The New York Times Book Review","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=zZFlmid0HOYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

Perfect for fans of Downton Abbey, it is the story of an aristocratic family, a house, a mysterious death and a way of life that vanished forever, told in flashback by a woman who witnessed it all and kept a secret for decades. Grace Bradley went to work at Riverton House as a servant when she was just a girl, before the First World War. For years her life was inextricably tied up with the Hartford family, most particularly the two daughters, Hannah and Emmeline. In the summer of 1924, at a glittering society party held at the house, a young poet shot himself. The only witnesses were Hannah and Emmeline and only they\u2014and Grace\u2014know the truth. In 1999, when Grace is ninety-eight years old and living out her last days in a nursing home, she is visited by a young director who is making a film about the events of that summer. She takes Grace back to Riverton House and reawakens her memories. Told in flashback, this is the story of Grace's youth during the last days of Edwardian aristocratic privilege shattered by war, of the vibrant twenties and the changes she witnessed as an entire way of life vanished forever. The novel is full of secrets\u2014some revealed, others hidden forever, reminiscent of the romantic suspense of Daphne du Maurier. It is also a meditation on memory, the devastation of war and a beautifully rendered window into a fascinating time in history. Kate Morton\u2019s first novel, originally published to critical acclaim in Australia, and quickly becoming a #1 bestseller in England, The House at Riverton is a vivid, page-turning novel of suspense and passion, with characters\u2014and an ending\u2014readers won't soon forget.","Image_Url":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=AdQhoNVAjkUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}
